Changes to HTML files:
All:
- Moved all non-inline css to a separate file
1.html:
- Imported fonts from google
- Made the links in the table of contents refer to sections of the document locally, rather than redirecting to an internet address (to prevent the ToC from sending users to the original project gutenburg chapter online)
- Removed the inline styling for the Table of Contents and replaced it with a class so I could center the ToC on the page.
