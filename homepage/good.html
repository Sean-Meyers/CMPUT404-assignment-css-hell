                <h2>Who am I!?</h2>
                <p>Hi there! I'm a fourth-year Computing Science major at the
                    University of Alberta with a minor in Business. I was born
                    and raised in Edmonton, Alberta, and I'm passionate about
                    programming, game design, computers, and the arts!

                <h2>A Little History</h2>
                <p> I have always been drawn to the world of game development.
                    In fact, it was my passion for game development that
                    initially led me to explore the world of programming.
                    As I delved deeper into the world of computing, however,
                    I discovered a new passion: the art and science of
                    programming itself.

                    a Game Developer, I have experience with professional game
                    engines like Unreal Engine and Unity, and I have a strong
                    foundation in low-level hardware, Graphics Programming, AI,
                    and Game Design. My experience in visual and aural arts
                    also gives me a unique perspective on working with artists
                    and musicians to create compelling game experiences.

                    programming itself.
                </p>
                <p>For me, programming is more than just a means to an end; it
                    is a passion in and of itself. I love the feeling of
                    bringing my creations to life, and I find great satisfaction
                    in learning new languages, frameworks, and tools. Although
                    my passion for game development remains strong, I have also
                    developed a keen curiosity in other areas of computing,
                    including Web Development and Machine Learning. I have
                    taken a wide range of courses to explore these areas, and I
                    am always seeking out new challenges and opportunities to
                    learn.
                </p>
                <p>Currently, my specialties include graphics programming, web
                    development, game AI, and Android development. However, I
                    recognize that there is always more to learn, both within
                    and beyond these domains. That is why, despite being a
                    fourth year student, I am committed to continuing my
                    education and pursuing new opportunities for growth.
                </p>
                <p>Recently, I was accepted into the BSc with Specialization,
                    Computing Science with Business Minor program, which has
                    given me the opportunity to explore a new area of interest.
                    While my ultimate goal is to start and run my own successful
                    game development studio, I am keeping my options open and
                    remaining open to new possibilities. With a strong foundation
                    in computing science and a passion for learning and growth,
                    I am excited to see where my journey will take me next.

                <h2>Who am I!?</h2>
                <p>Hi there! I'm a fourth-year Computing Science major at the
                    University of Alberta with a minor in Business. I was born
                    and raised in Edmonton, Alberta, and I'm passionate about
                    programming, game design, computers, and the arts!
                </p>
                <p>When I'm not studying or working on programming projects, I
                    love to explore my creative side through sound design, music
                    composition and illustration. I also enjoy reading manga and
                    light novels, watching anime, and playing games in my free
                    time.    
                </p>
                <p>I have always had a thing for making games. When I was in
                    elementary school, making games was my go-to way to avoid
                    doing schoolwork. Now that I am in university, making games
                    sometimes IS my schoolwork. I have experience working with
                    Unity and Unreal Engine, and I have taken courses in
                    Game AI, Game Programming, Graphics Programming, GPU
                    Programming, Numerical Methods, Game Design, Software
                    Engineering, Music Composition, and Music Technology.
                </p>
                <p>In addition to my interest in game development, I'm also
                    fascinated by other areas of computing science, particularly
                    Web Development and Machine Learning. I'm always seeking
                    out new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow. I'm
                    grateful for the opportunities I've had so far to pursue my
                    passions and develop my skills.

                <h2>What I have to offer...</h2>
                <p>Be it as a Game Developer or Software Engineer, I bring a
                    diverse range of experience and expertise to the table. As
                    a Game Developer, I have experience with professional game

                    also gives me a unique perspective on working with artists
                    and musicians to create compelling game experiences.
                </p>
                <p>I have also taken courses in Psychology, Business, and
                    Economics, which have proven invaluable in helping me
                    understand players and design engaging game mechanics.
                    These skills are not only applicable to game development
                    but can be useful in many other domains as well.
                </p>
                <p>As a Software Engineer, I have a broad range of skills and
                    expertise that go beyond game development. I have experience
                    in web development, mobile development, scientific and
                    parallel computing, and database management. Additionally,
                    my experience in game development gives me access to
                    gamification techniques, which have become increasingly
                    popular in a variety of domains and applications, including
                    productivity-enhancing software, education, advertising,
                    social media, and more.
                </p>
                <p>My breadth of experience allows me to approach problems from
                    multiple angles and find creative solutions that meet the
                    unique needs of each project. Whether I'm working on a game,
                    a web application, or a research project, I'm always looking
                    for ways to incorporate innovative and effective solutions
                    that will deliver results. With my passion for programming
                    and my diverse skill set, I'm confident that I can make a
                    valuable contribution to any team or project.
